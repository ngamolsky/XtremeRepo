# Upload Tab Removal and Floating Action Button Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Updates
- **Removed Upload Tab**: Deleted the upload tab from the main navigation in `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed unused `Upload` icon import from lucide-react

### 2. Created Floating Action Button Component
- **New Component**: `src/components/ui/FloatingActionButton.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Reusable floating action button with customizable icon
  - Primary and secondary variants
  - Positioned fixed bottom-right with smooth animations
  - Accessible with screen reader support

### 3. History Tab Enhancements
- **Added FAB**: Floating action button with Plus icon for adding new races
- **Race Detail Navigation**: Made each race card clickable to navigate to detail page
- **New Route**: Created `src/routes/history.$year.tsx` for individual race details
- **New Component**: `src/components/RaceDetailView.tsx` with features:
  - View race summary and leg results
  - Edit race data inline
  - Upload CSV functionality integrated
  - Save/cancel editing capabilities

### 4. Photos Tab Enhancements
- **Added FAB**: Floating action button with Plus icon for uploading photos
- **Modal Integration**: Added dialog component for photo upload
- **Removed Static Upload Section**: Replaced the bottom upload section with FAB
- **Upload Dialog**: Full `UploadPhotosView` component embedded in modal

### 5. Route Management
- **Deleted Upload Route**: Removed `src/routes/upload.tsx` since upload functionality is now integrated into other tabs
- **Fixed Vite Config**: Corrected syntax error in `vite.config.ts` (removed double comma)

## Key Features Implemented

### Race Detail Page (`/history/{year}`)
- **View Mode**: Display race summary, placement, and leg results
- **Edit Mode**: Inline editing of race data with save/cancel
- **CSV Upload**: Direct integration with existing `UploadResultsView` component
- **Navigation**: Back button to history list, breadcrumb navigation

### Floating Action Buttons
- **History FAB**: Opens race detail page in edit mode for current year
- **Photos FAB**: Opens photo upload modal dialog
- **Consistent Design**: Both use the same FAB component with different icons

### Upload Functionality Preservation
- **Results Upload**: Now accessible from race detail pages and history FAB
- **Photos Upload**: Now accessible from photos FAB in modal dialog
- **All Features Maintained**: No upload functionality was lost, just relocated

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Removed upload tab
- `src/components/HistoryView.tsx` - Added FAB and navigation links
- `src/components/PhotosView.tsx` - Added FAB and modal dialog
- `src/routes/upload.tsx` - Deleted (functionality moved to other components)
- `vite.config.ts` - Fixed syntax error

## Files Created
- `src/components/ui/FloatingActionButton.tsx` - Reusable FAB component
- `src/routes/history.$year.tsx` - Race detail route
- `src/components/RaceDetailView.tsx` - Race detail page component

## Benefits
- **Better UX**: Floating action buttons provide quick access to common actions
- **Contextual Uploads**: Upload functionality is now contextual to the data being viewed
- **Cleaner Navigation**: Reduced navigation clutter by removing dedicated upload tab
- **Enhanced Race Management**: Individual race pages allow for better data management
- **Preserved Functionality**: All upload features still available, just better integrated

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The development server should automatically regenerate route types to include the new history detail route.
